I read a Permatâ€™s last theorem this weekend.
It was not so difficult to figure out the main idea of proof(but I could not understand any formula at all) because I already read it around 6 years ago. This time I found a clip interviewing Andrew Wiles on Youtube. He touched me deeply.
I tried to look for his recent work but I could not. As for his personality, he might surprise us again soon.
