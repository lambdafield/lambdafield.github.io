I have finished reading a Prime Obsession which explains about the Riemann hypothesis which is the 8th Hibertâ€™s problem.
I bought this book around 4 years ago and then I tried to read it at that time but I gave up after reading a half of the book.
In fact, even now I could not completely understand the last part of this book.
It is a very natural thing to skip complicated parts.
Next time, after more than 1 year, I might try to read this book again then will be able to figure out the rest.
