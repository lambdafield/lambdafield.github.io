I had finished reading a [Prime Obsession](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Obsession) which explains about Riemann hypothesis is 8th Hibert's problem.
I bought this book around 4 years ago and then I tried to read it at that time but I gave up after reading a half of the book.
In fact, even now I could not understand completely the last part of this book.
It is very natural thing to skip complicated part.
Next time, after more than 1 year, I might try to read this book again then will be able to figure out the rest part.
