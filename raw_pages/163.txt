Sometimes I donâ€™t want to waste my time making a presentation which is not so important. At the first stage, I want to focus on the contents, not care about font size, font style etc.
Today I checked out [pydown](http://github.com/isnowfy/pwdown)

    pip install python-pydown

and then edit slide.md.

    !SLIDE
    # Hello
    !SLIDE
    # Another slide
    !SLIDE left
    # left
   
lastly, generate it. That's all.
